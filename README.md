# ServiceChain deploy tool
A wrapper tool for [klaytn-terraform](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-terraform) and [klaytn-ansible](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-ansible).
It first runs *klaytn-terraform* to create VMs on AWS,
then runs *klaytn-ansible* to install and deploy klaytn service chain on the created VMs.

## Prerequisites
You need an AWS account. Also, AWS-CLI should be configured correctly in your local environment.
Refer to AWS docs to [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) AWS-CLI.
